# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Addressed a highly imbalanced dataset through under-sampling to ensure model fairness. Trained a Logistic Regression classifier that achieved ~94% accuracy on the test data in identifying fraudulent activity.
